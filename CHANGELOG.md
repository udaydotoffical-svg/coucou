# Changelog

## 0.1.8 — October 5, 2026

- Coucou on iPhone: turn on Settings → General → iPhone (off by default) and your agent sessions show up live in the Coucou iPhone app and its widgets, through your own private iCloud. Project names, commands and questions are encrypted with your iCloud keys; turning it off deletes them (#209, #211, #212, #213)
- Allow or deny a permission from the iPhone: a notification with the command, Deny right from it, Allow behind Face ID. Your Mac only applies a decision meant for the exact request it is waiting on, and the request expires after 2 minutes. The iPhone keeps a history of your decisions (#220)
- Lock your Mac while an agent works and Mochi moves to your iPhone's Lock Screen and Dynamic Island, then comes back to the notch when you unlock. Turn it on under Settings → General → iPhone. It goes through a small relay that only sees the agent's name and state (#221)
- Mochi, the pills and the diff engine now live in a shared package used by both apps; nothing changes in the notch (#210)
- The iPhone sees more of what your Mac sees: every service Mochi (GitHub, Stripe, Vercel, Resend, Cal.com, n8n, Notion) with its latest items, and the last turn of each session with its commands and diffs, all encrypted with your iCloud keys. No API key ever leaves the Mac (#224)
- Send the next instruction to Claude Code from the iPhone (GitHub build, off by default): your Mac picks it up within 15 seconds and continues the session in its own folder (#224)
- Answer Claude's questions from the iPhone: your Mac applies an answer only if it matches the question still waiting (#241)
- The Live Activity counts the time since Mochi left, and shows Allow and Deny while a command waits for you (#232, #241)
- A new coucou sound for Mochi's greeting (#241)

## 0.1.7 — October 4, 2026

- Keyboard shortcuts from anywhere: ⌃⌥Space opens the chat, ⌃⌥A jumps to a waiting permission or question, ⌃⌥T brings your terminal forward, ⌃⌥] and ⌃⌥[ switch pills, ⌃⌥M mutes Mochi, ⌃⌥D sends him to the desktop and back, ⌃⌥G opens the wardrobe, and ⌃⌥W attaches the front window to the chat (GitHub build) (#205)
- In the open island: ⌘← ⌘→ and ⌘1–9 switch pills, ⌘↑ ⌘↓ and ⌘O move through a card's list, ⌘E opens the diff, ⌘↩ sends, ⌘K starts a new chat, ⌘P pins the island (#205)
- Every global shortcut can be changed or turned off in Settings → Shortcuts, which also flags combinations another app already uses. They need no Accessibility permission (#205)
- ⌘⇧N now opens and closes the island (#205)

## 0.1.6 — October 4, 2026

- Mochi on the desktop: drag him out of the notch and drop him anywhere on your desktop. He hangs out there, follows your cursor with his eyes, wears his outfit and dances to your music (#198)
- When Claude needs you, he flies back to the notch with the permission or the question, then returns to his spot once you answer. He does a happy jump when a task finishes (#198)
- Click him to poke him, right-click for the wardrobe, drop him on a window to attach it to the chat (GitHub build), and drop him on the notch or double-click him to bring him home (#198)
- He falls asleep when nothing is going on, and remembers his spot between launches (#198)

## 0.1.5 — October 4, 2026

- Dress Mochi up: right-click him to open the wardrobe and pick a party hat, beanie, crown, witch hat, Santa hat, bunny ears, bow, sunglasses, round glasses, scarf or pumpkin, all drawn in code (#195)
- Auto mode dresses Mochi for the seasons on his own (#195)
- Outfits follow his head in 3D, glasses stay on his eyes, soft parts react when you tap or move him, and outfits come and go with a transition. Only the main Mochi wears them (#195)
- A new launch greeting: Mochi drops into the island, bounces, slides to the side and waves hello with a quick little hand, then comes back, with a new soft whisper of a sound (#196)
- Mochi's body is no longer clipped at two corners during the greeting (#196)

## 0.1.4 — October 3, 2026

- See what Claude is editing, live: each file edit shows up in the session ticker with its +N −M lines, and a click opens the diff right in the notch (#177)
- When Claude finishes, the session card shows its final message instead of the last step, without the shimmer (#177, #179)
- GitHub pill: your open pull requests with their CI status, the pull requests waiting for your review, and the CI of the default branch of your recent repos. Click a row for the list, then an item to open it on github.com (#181)
- GitHub alerts: a badge and a sound when the CI of one of your pull requests turns red or green, when a default branch breaks, or when someone requests your review. Fast CI runs are caught too, and the card refreshes when you open it (#181, #185)
- Your GitHub contribution grid: the last 7 days in the GitHub card header, click it for the past 23 weeks, and click a day for its count (#187)
- The GitHub token needs read access to pull requests and CI: a classic token with the repo scope, or a fine-grained token with read access to Pull requests, Commit statuses and Actions (#181)
- The finished view no longer overflows the card (#179)

## 0.1.3 — October 3, 2026

- Answer Claude's questions from the notch: when Claude Code asks a multiple-choice question, pick an option or type your own answer right in the island, and Reply in terminal hands it back. Update your hooks in Settings to turn it on (#165) — thanks @Vega8991 for the idea (#94)
- Claude plan usage (GitHub build): turn on Settings → Agents → Plan usage to see your 5-hour and weekly limits in a small pill in the notch header, and click it for the details and reset times. Pro and Max plans; your current status line keeps working (#159)
- Chat with local models through Ollama or LM Studio, no API key needed: connect them in Settings → Chat → Local models. Answers stream in, and thinking blocks stay hidden (#156)
- Markdown in chat answers: bold, lists, headings, quotes, and code blocks with a copy button. Links open only when they are web links (#156)
- Apple Music (GitHub build): see what is playing in the notch, play, pause and skip on hover, and Mochi dances along (#144, #153)
- Settings are now organized in a sidebar (#153)
- The chat greets you by your own first name (#154)

## 0.1.2 — October 2, 2026

- Codex support (GitHub build): sessions show up live on the Codex pill, and permission requests get Allow and Deny in the notch. Install from Settings → Codex Hooks, then trust the hooks once with /hooks in Codex (#130) — thanks @lacatu5
- Cursor: Claude Code started in Cursor's terminal shows up on the Cursor pill, and you can answer its permission requests from the notch (#120).
- Pick your main coding tool in Settings → Active pills: VS Code, Cursor, Codex or Antigravity (Codex and Antigravity: GitHub build). It stays on and no longer takes one of the 4 slots (#120).
- The permission card stays in the notch until you answer it: the mouse no longer folds it, and reopening the island shows the request again (#117).
- The permission card also shows when the island is already open, and the pill you were on comes back once you answer (#120).

## 0.1.1 — October 2, 2026

- Declare the tools you use in Settings: Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Anthropic, Google AI and OpenAI pills join the existing ones (Cursor and Codex pills are coming soon), and you pick the main pill.
- Chat now supports Google AI (Gemini) and OpenAI in addition to Anthropic; switch provider and model by clicking the model name in the chat view, on macOS.
- Linux version: the Tauri app now builds for Linux too (AppImage, .deb, .rpm), with the island as a layer-shell overlay on Wayland and Claude Code hooks over a private Unix socket (#21) — thanks @Davy133
- Compact island on screens without a notch (#22) — thanks @Kamasoutra
- Only web links (http/https) open from the notch; other kinds of links from Claude or integrations are ignored (#16) — thanks @Cris1670
- Hook socket limited to your own user account, with size and time limits; logs no longer keep commands, n8n data or full URLs, and stay under 1 MB (#16) — thanks @Cris1670 and @Vignesh-Thangamariappan
- The island always reopens after folding, and Settings opens below it, resizable — thanks @rouderz
- Choose the Claude model for the chat in Settings; the list comes from your Anthropic account, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 stays the default — thanks @rouderz
- Windows build artifacts are now downloadable from a manual CI run — thanks @MysJofR
- Any agent can talk to Mochi: tag a hook payload with `coucou_agent` (e.g. `nb-hook --agent my-agent`) and it gets its own pill in the island (#7, #9) — thanks @lacatu5
- Gemini CLI and Antigravity (agy) hook support on macOS: install from Settings and their sessions show up in the island — thanks @corefusiion
